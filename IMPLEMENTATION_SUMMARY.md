# Form Submissions & Admin Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented form submissions to Supabase database and created admin dashboard views for managing employee applications and hiring requests, including CV file download functionality.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Setup
- Created `DATABASE_SETUP.md` with SQL schemas for two new tables:
  - `employee_applications` - Stores candidate applications with CV file support
  - `hiring_requests` - Stores client hiring requests
- Both tables include status tracking and timestamps
- Configured for Supabase Storage integration for CV files

### 2. Form Submissions

#### CandidateApplication.js
- ✅ **Form submission to database**: Now saves to `employee_applications` table
- ✅ **CV file upload**: Uploads files to Supabase Storage bucket `cv-files`
- ✅ **Error handling**: Proper error messages and success feedback
- ✅ **Form validation**: All required fields validated
- ✅ **User feedback**: Success/error messages displayed to users

#### ClientHiring.js
- ✅ **Form submission to database**: Now saves to `hiring_requests` table
- ✅ **Error handling**: Proper error messages and success feedback
- ✅ **Form validation**: All required fields validated
- ✅ **User feedback**: Success/error messages displayed to users

### 3. Admin Dashboard Enhancements

#### New Navigation Tabs
- ✅ **Employee Applications**: View and manage candidate applications
- ✅ **Hiring Requests**: View and manage client hiring requests

#### Employee Applications Dashboard
- ✅ **View all applications**: Table view with key information
- ✅ **CV download functionality**: Click to download CV files
- ✅ **Status management**: Dropdown to update application status
- ✅ **Application details**: View full application details
- ✅ **Real-time updates**: Refresh button to fetch latest data

#### Hiring Requests Dashboard
- ✅ **View all requests**: Table view with key information
- ✅ **Status management**: Dropdown to update request status
- ✅ **Request details**: View full request details
- ✅ **Real-time updates**: Refresh button to fetch latest data

### 4. CV File Download System
- ✅ **Secure file storage**: Files stored in private Supabase Storage bucket
- ✅ **Download functionality**: Admin can download CV files with original filenames
- ✅ **Error handling**: Proper error messages if download fails
- ✅ **File type support**: Supports PDF, DOC, DOCX files

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Run the SQL commands from `DATABASE_SETUP.md` in your Supabase SQL Editor to create the required tables.

### 2. Storage Setup
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Storage
3. Create a new bucket called `cv-files`
4. Set the bucket to private (not public)

### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure your `.env` file contains:
```
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Features

### For Candidates (CandidateApplication.js)
- Submit application with personal details
- Upload CV file (PDF, DOC, DOCX)
- Receive confirmation message
- Automatic redirect after successful submission

### For Clients (ClientHiring.js)
- Submit hiring request with company details
- Provide role overview and requirements
- Receive confirmation message
- Automatic redirect after successful submission

### For Admins (AdminDashboard.js)
- View all employee applications in organized table
- Download CV files with one click
- Update application status (pending → reviewed → contacted → hired/rejected)
- View all hiring requests in organized table
- Update request status (pending → reviewed → contacted → in_progress → completed/cancelled)
- View detailed information for each application/request
- Refresh data on demand

## Status Workflow

### Employee Applications
1. **Pending** - New application submitted
2. **Reviewed** - Admin has reviewed the application
3. **Contacted** - Candidate has been contacted
4. **Hired** - Candidate was successfully placed
5. **Rejected** - Application was not suitable

### Hiring Requests
1. **Pending** - New request submitted
2. **Reviewed** - Admin has reviewed the request
3. **Contacted** - Client has been contacted
4. **In Progress** - Actively working on the request
5. **Completed** - Request successfully fulfilled
6. **Cancelled** - Request was cancelled

## Security Features
- Private file storage for CV files
- Status-based access control
- Secure file download through Supabase Storage
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling for all database operations

## Next Steps
1. Run the database setup SQL commands
2. Create the `cv-files` storage bucket
3. Test form submissions
4. Verify admin dashboard functionality
5. Test CV download feature

The implementation is complete and ready for use!
