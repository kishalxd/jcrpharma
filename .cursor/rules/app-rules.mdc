The app has this structure:
```
src/
    assets/
        logo.png (etc etc)
    components/
    pages/
```

Create components so that those can be reused. before creating always check for existing components.
All pages should be inside the `pages/` folder.

For creating pages. Do not create css files. Use tailwind.

For the backend, Supabase is used. For authentication too.
